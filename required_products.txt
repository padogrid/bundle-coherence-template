#
# PadoGrid bundle environment. This bundle requires the product versions listed below.
# Note that the required product versions listed in the file override the product
# versions that make up the bundle name.
#
# Specify ony the version number parts that are required. For example, if the bundle
# can be run on all versions of Coherence 14.x.x, then specify 14 only. If it applies to
# 14.1.x, then 14.1. If the bundle applies to multiple specific versions, then list them
# comma-separated. For example, the following applies to Coherence 12.2.1.4 and 14.1.x
#
# coherence=12.2.1.4,14.1.x
#
# To deemphasize products, i.e., product not required, requires multiple products, etc.,
# then set none=1.
